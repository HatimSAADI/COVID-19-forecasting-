# COVID-19-forecasting-
Predicting and forecasting the evolution of daily increased cases in Morocco and the world using Machine Learning models.
This project presents a dedicated machine learning model to predict the number of cases infected by the Coronavirus; the case of Morocco and Worldwide was chosen to validate this study. It is Completely realized with the 'Python' language and tested for a certain number of algorithms generated on datasets coming from dedicated sources to gather Covid19 data in the world. The results show the possibility of achieving better scores prediction after using the proposed method. The proposed Machine Learning model can be applied to data from any country in the world. We have applied it in this paper to the case of Morocco and Worldwide. We are sending this work to the world to help them fight COVID-19.
